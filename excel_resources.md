These are supporting materials for my talk on forecasting data identified non-compliance (DINC) at the [2018 CEDR conference](https://www.cedrconf.org/). I'll be updating this document as we get closer to the event.

Basic Formulas

-   There are a lot of YouTube videos on this topic. [Here is one example](https://youtu.be/1naiWCWfSt4)

How Sorting Works in Excel
--------------------------

Sorting rows in Excel is a really useful task, but doing it incorrectly can lead to some columns sorting and others not. When you sort, you definitely want all the cells in a row to stick together.

How Dates Work in Excel
-----------------------

In my talk on predicting DINC items, I subtracted one date from another to find the number of days between two dates. There are different ways to get that result in Excel. Here's more to read on this topic:

The Differences Between Excel and Coding
----------------------------------------

If you like working with data in Excel, you may find yourself wanting to explore programming in a language like R or Python. If working with data in Excel is like cooking a caserole, then coding to work with data is like writing a recipe. Let's keep go with the cooking analogy and look at some advantages:

-   When you want to change something in your result, you just need to change the recipe
-   If you've made a mistake, you can always review every line of your recipe to identify the problem area
-   Recipes can be shared with others so they can also make your data caserole. Or they can improve your recipe and share it back with you
-   Functional programming skills allow you to take a recipe and make not just one caserole, but hundreds or thousands at once
